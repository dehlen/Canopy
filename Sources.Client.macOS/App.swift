//TODO the infinite notifications bug is quite a problem
//   either debug it or just switch to Vapor

//TODO icon
//TODO need a safe way to shutdown the server app
//TODO can we rely on push to deliver the oauth token back? Debug mode suggests not.
//TODO research scaling AWS instance
//TODO prettier authorizingâ€¦ webpage
//TODO FAQ on website that desribes how we get private data briefly (maybe github apps can fix that?)
//  talks about future server app distibution, talks about how we plan to improve this
//TODO validate and verify hook secrets

//TODO organization events have to be directed someplace, maybe API request to get list of members?
//TODO ensure we keep SSL certificate up-to-date, look into automating it
//TODO ensure our Apple Developer account renews 
//TODO look into how sqlite handles crashes and CTRL-C
//TODO db backups
//TODO ensure we are transactional where it counts (let's never break ffs!)
//TODO allow disabling actions made by yourself (leave *on* since it is a good wow-moment to get the push when you do stuff)
//TODO organization subscription plan
//TODO uninstall webhook
//TODO get a read-only token for server: https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#creating-multiple-tokens-for-oauth-apps
//TODO check for webhook on github end if user is admin when selecting repo or organization in the outline-view

//TODO actually it is possible to create multiple hooks with the same configuration
//  well, maybe if the secret varies? Maybe should make the secret some one way hash of a salt + the repo name instead?
//  eitherway should detect this and prevent it.
//TODO restore checking that the webhook is still installed somewhere, since user can delete it themselves (or switch to app!)
//TODO show red if notify enabled by webhook has been removed (can do periodic test server side using test API)
